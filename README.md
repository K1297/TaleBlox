# Canister documentation 

## Types

**Story**

A Story is represented by the following fields:

* **id:** A unique identifier for the story.
* **title:** The title of the story.
* **initialAuthor:** The author of the first page of the story.
* **pageCount:** The total number of pages in the story.
* **pages:** An array of Page objects representing the story's pages.
* **owner:** The principal of the story's owner.

**Page**

A Page is represented by the following fields:

* **id:** A unique identifier for the page.
* **author:** The author of the page.
* **prompt:** The prompt for the page.
* **content:** The content of the page.
* **image:** The URL of the associated image.

**NFT**

An NFT is used to represent the index of a story associated with an NFT.

## Actor Class

The TaleBlox actor class is the core component of the canister, responsible for managing stories and NFTs. It contains functions for creating stories, contributing to stories, and minting NFTs.

## Functions

* **createStory(id, title, prompt, content, imageUrl, metadataUrl)**
This function allows users to create a new story with the specified parameters. It mints an NFT for the associated image and initializes the story.

* **contributeToStory(storyId, prompt, content, imageUrl, metadataUrl)**
Users can contribute to existing stories using this function. It also mints NFTs for associated images and adds a new page to the story.

* **getAllStories()**
This query function returns a list of all existing stories.

## Minting NFTs
Minting NFTs is done internally within the canister. The mintImageAsNFT private function is responsible for this process. It should take a metadata URL as input and return true if successful or false if there's an error.

## Queries
The canister supports a single query function, getAllStories, which allows users to retrieve a list of all available stories.

# Troubleshooting 

* **Check Internet Connection**

Before attempting any troubleshooting steps, ensure that you have a stable and active internet connection. Internet Identity relies on a connection to the Internet to function correctly.

* **Supported Browsers**

Internet Identity is designed to work with modern web browsers. Make sure you are using a supported browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Ensure your browser is up-to-date.

* **Clear Browser Cache**

Cached data in your browser can sometimes cause issues. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies. Instructions for doing this vary depending on your browser, so consult your browser's documentation.

* **Identity Provider Issues**

Internet Identity relies on identity providers like DFINITY Foundation's Identity Provider (IDP). If the IDP experiences downtime or issues, it can affect your ability to log in. Check the status of the identity provider, if possible.
